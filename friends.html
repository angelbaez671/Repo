    <h2>Deadpool's Friends</h2>
    <ol>
    <h3>
      <li>Weasle</li>
    </h3>
    <p>He is Deadpool's friend/henchman, technology expert and weapons dealer.
       Weasel appears in the Deadpool movie and is played by actor T.J. Miller.
       He is not portrayed as the wizz-kid as he is in the comics, but more as a
       nerdy bartender whom associates with mercenaries. He helps Deadpool out on
       a number of times during the movie.</p>

    <h3>
      <li>Vanessa Geraldine Carlysle aka Copycat</li>
    </h3>
    <p>Copycat was a mutant who possessed the ability to shape-shift as well as
      to copy any power from another individual after a period of physical contact.
      Vanessa Carlysle plays a vital role in the Deadpool movie. In the film she
      is portrayed by Morena Baccarin. There are a few changes to the character,
      the most notable being that Vanessa doesn't exhibit any powers, and lacks a
      codename. She does retain the role of mercenary, and that is how she and Wade
      Wilson meet.</p>

    <p>She Deadpool's former roommate/hostage who has been known to share a love/hate
      relationship with the wisecracking mercenary. Blind Al is a part of the Deadpool
      movie. She is played by actor Leslie Uggams. She is portrayed much like her
      comic-book counterpart and serves as mother-figure to Deadpool.</p>

    <h3>
      <li>Colossus</li>
    </h3>
    <p>Piotr Rasputin is a Russian mutant who possesses the ability to transform
      his body into organic steel, giving him immense strength and durability. Colossus
      is among the physically strongest X-Men, and is a talented artist. Colossus appears
      as a supporting character in the movie, voiced by Serbian actor Stefan Kapičić.
      This version of the character is entirely CGI (with the motion capture provided by
      Andre Tricoteaux, and is over seven feet tall, allowing for a much closer
      approximation to his appearance from the comics. After hearing that Deadpool was
      causing trouple on the news, Colossus and his protégé try to convince Deadpool to
      stop being violent and join the X-Men. Deadpool refuses and fights Colossus after
      his target gets away. Colossus easily defeats Deadpool and handcuffs him, but Deadpool
      cuts off his hand and escapes. Later Deadpool shows up at the X-Men Mansion and asks
      for Colossus' help to defeat Ajax.</p>

    <h3>
      <li>Negasonic Teenage Warhead</li>
    </h3>
    <p>One of Emma Frost's students who died on Genosha, Frost clung on to Ellie
      Phimister's body until she was rescued. She created a telepathic construct
      of her known as the Negasonic Teenage Warhead during an assault on the X-Men.
      Phimister was later resurrected by Eli Bard and sacrificed to Selene. Brianna
      Hildebrand portrays Negasonic Teenage Warhead in the live-action Deadpool movie.
      In the continuity of the film, she is a teenage member of the X-Men who is being
      mentored by Colossus. The character does not have the same abilities, as her
      comic book namesake, and instead creates explosions that radiate from her body.</p>
